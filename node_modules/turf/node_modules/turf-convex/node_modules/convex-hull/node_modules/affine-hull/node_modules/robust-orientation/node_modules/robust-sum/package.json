  "readme": "robust-sum\n==========\nComputes the sum of two increasing non-overlapping sequences of floats as an increasing non-overlapping sequence.  This can be used to perform exact arithmetic calculations on floating point values.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n* Jonathan Richard Shewchuk, [\"Adaptive precision floating-point arithmetic and fast robust geometric predicates\"](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/quake/public/papers/robust-arithmetic.ps). 1997\n\n## Install\n\n\t\tnpm install robust-sum\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar robustSum = require(\"robust-sum\")\n\nvar seq = robustSum([1, 64], [1e-64, 1e64])\nconsole.log(\"result = \", seq)\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `require(\"robust-sum\")(a, b)`\nComputes the sum of two non-overlapping increasing sequences of floats exactly as a non-overlapping increasing sequence of floats.\n\n* `a` is a non-overlapping sequence of floats that is increasing in magnitude\n* `b` is a non-overlapping sequence of floats that is increasing magnitude\n\n**Returns** A non-overlapping increasing sequence that encodes the result of `a+b`\n\n## Credits\nBased on JRS' robust geometric predicates for floating point arithmetic.\n\nImplementation (c) 2013 Mikola Lysenko.
